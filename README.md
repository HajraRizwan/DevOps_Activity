## Repository Details

- **Created by:** Hajra Rizwan  
- **Collaborators:** The team members listed above  

## Project Overview
This repository will contain a React application along with DevOps-related activities, configurations, and best practices.

---

## Branching & Collaboration
- Each team member **created their own branch**.  
- Everyone **committed their changes** separately.  
- Then, all members **pushed their branches** to the remote repository.  
In this way, we learned how to work together without disturbing the main project.

---

## Pull Requests & Merge
- After making changes, each member **created a Pull Request (PR)**.  
- PRs were reviewed before merging into the main branch.  
- Finally, changes were **merged** successfully.  
In simple words: we learned how to safely bring everyone's work together into one place.

---

## Learning Outcome (Easy Words)
- We understood **how branches help us work separately** without breaking each other’s code.  
- We learned **how Pull Requests help in reviewing and discussing code** before merging.  
- We saw **how merging combines everyone's work** into the main project.  
- In short: **Branch → Work safely**, **PR → Review & Share**, **Merge → Join work together**.
