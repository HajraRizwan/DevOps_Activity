## Branching Strategy
We created **four branches** to work individually and safely:  
- `hajra-branch`  
- `aleeha-branch`  
- `mahnoor-branch`  
- `azka-branch`  

Each branch was used to make changes in **README.md**

## Learning Outcomes
Through this activity, we learned:  
- **Branching** → Work separately and safely without disturbing the main project.  
- **Collaboration** → Multiple contributors can work on the same repository effectively.  
- **Pull Requests** → Share work for peer review before merging.  
- **Conflict Resolution** → Handle merge conflicts and ensure project stability.  
- **Merging** → Combine everyone’s work into the main branch smoothly.  
- **Best Practices** → Follow proper DevOps workflows in version control.
